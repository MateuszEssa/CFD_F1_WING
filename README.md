Simulation of a F1 front wing

GroundFineImproved case refers to to Second Order Spatial Discretization scheme (bounded Gauss linearUpwind limited in divSchemes) and K-Omega turbulence model. 

GroundFineStandard case refers to to Second Order Spatial Discretization scheme (Gauss upwind in divSchemes) and K-Omega turbulence model.
